# Contributing

You can contribute in two ways: 
1. CSS or JS
2. Site

# CSS or JS
To contribute to the css or js, download the files (`index.js` and `tailwind.css`), unminify them and then make changes to them. You **Need** to minify them after you have done it. Now just create an issue with the tag `enhancement` or `feature` with a link to a [Gist](https://gist.github.com) or a link to the finished file and if we see it and like it, it will get published.
# Site
To contribute to the site, [set up a ghostcss project](https://ghostcss.netlify.app/docs/getting-started) and download the source code for the site. You can make any changes and then make an issue with the tag `enhancement` or `documentation` with a link to the finished source code and with luck, it will get published!
